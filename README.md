# MandelbrotViewer
Simple graphical application for browsing Mandelbrot fractal, built with SFML library. For calculations, a shader written in GLSL is used. 

Unfortunately, due to precision limitations, only shallow zoom is supported. I tried to implement arbitrary-precision arithmetic but failed. Anyway, it was too slow. May be some day I will fix bugs in it and implement calculation using perturbation theory.
